                <h2>About Blackbear</h2>
                <p>Matthew Tyler Musto (born November 27, 1990), professionally known as Blackbear (stylized as blackbear), is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He has released six studio albums, six EPs, one mixtape and two collaborative albums. Musto is also a member of the alternative hip hop duo Mansionz with singer-songwriter Mike Posner.</p>
                <p>Musto was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, and moved to Palm Coast as a child. His father is of Italian descent. He has stated that many of his family members are from Pittston, Pennsylvania. In fourth grade, he became interested in music through Rancid, Blink-182, and bands his babysitter introduced him to, such as New Found Glory and Alkaline Trio.</p>
                <p>In high school, Musto was the singer of Florida-based rock band Polaroid. They released one album, Paint The Town; one EP, Inside And Out; and one demo, The Cure Demo and have been variously described as being a pop punk, punk rock, and garage band. During Musto's freshman year of high school, the band signed to Leakmob Records. Musto dropped out of school in the 10th grade to focus on music. As Polaroid progressed, their music became increasingly influenced by emo. By 2008, Musto had also begun to write his own solo music.
                After leaving Polaroid, Musto began a solo career when he moved to Atlanta to work with Ne-Yo. He put out his first EP entitled Brightness in 2008, followed by Contrast in 2009, and Exposure in 2010. He put out the Christmas song "I Hate the Holidays" with Tyler Carter, then-member of the band Woe, Is Me in late-2010, shortly followed by a new single, "Douche Bag" in early-January 2011. In mid-2011, Musto released both the Gone For Good EP and the Year of the Blackbear EP. In fall 2011, Musto decided to use his nickname Blackbear as his pseudonym when making music. The first song to be released with the Blackbear moniker is Mike Posner's "Marauder Music" in November 2011.</p>
